# Travel-Agency
A simple, fully functional travel agency page built using only HTML. This project showcases travel packages and top itineraries for Japan, focusing on creating a responsive, user-friendly experience. Developed as part of my journey with #100Devs and freeCodeCamp, it demonstrates my ability to build static pages with semantic HTML.
